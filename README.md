# Alexa Magic Card Database

This Skill can recognize names of cards printed from Theros block all the way up to Aether Revolt. To use the skill, simply say the name of a card, and Alexa will guide you through the rest. The skill is invoked with the phrase "Magic Card Database". As of posting, the Skill is under review by the Alexa Skills team. I will update with a link to the skill, which must be enabled on an Alexa device, when the certification is complete.

Information about getting started with an Alexa device can be found in Amazon's documentation, <a href="https://github.com/alexa">here</a>.
